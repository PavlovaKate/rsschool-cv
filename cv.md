## About Myself:

I’ve been working quite long as a specialist in financial department of
international brokerage company. However, I recently realized that I no
longer enjoy this job. I believe that working with passion allows you to
achieve your goals much faster and it’s core element of the working
process. Out of the blue I began to be interested in Front-end development.That's why I started RS School course thanks to which I want dive into this field more and more and explore its branches.
